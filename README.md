# Music Classifier ML
Machine learning stuff for my music classifier web app. You will find the ipynb file I used as well as the dataset I trained on. Note that I was unable to use the original Mel spectrograms from the GTZAN dataset as I was unable to reproduce similar spectrograms using the librosa python module from my end (needed to analyze youtube videos).
